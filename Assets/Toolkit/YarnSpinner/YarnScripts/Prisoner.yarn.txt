Oh, Brave warrior, you have returned to-

Well... please hurry up.

Fencer:...
...
Fencer: Yeah i got the rock.
Oh, Brave Warrior. Thank you kindly. A thousand gratitudes i place upon you.
Fencer: So, you want me to smash the shackle then?
Oh no no no.
Fencer: No?
Nooooo. I shall do it... later.
Fencer: Later? Why not right now?
No no. I have a few things i need to do first. A couple of items on the To Do list. Just some things to tick off before i can escape.
Fencer: Like what?
Oh nothing of importance to you, oh brave warrior. Just leave the rock with me. On the floor there.
Fencer: Here?
Yes. There!
ACTION: Fencer places rock down
Excellent. Now. Your reward.
Fencer: Oh, thank you. That wasn't necessary, but i appreciate it-
The key to the exit of this place.
Fencer: I-
Fencer: Thanks. But won't you need that? To escape?
Oh no, i shall be quite all right.
Fencer: You do actually plan on escaping right?
Of course. Is that not what a prisoner that is not a fish would do?
Fencer: I- I don't think the fish part is relevant.
And it should not be.
Now go. Leave me and this now Actually Useful Rock that has fulfilled its destiny to my To Do List.
Brave Warrior. I thank you once again.
Fencer: O-okay. Thank you for the key.
You are most welcome.
Fencer got the Dungeon Exit key thing!

What? What is it?
Fencer: (sighs) Nothing. I guess.
Well, run along then. No offence but you're a little too weird for me to be seen hanging around you.
Fencer:!!!!

Hello, i am a humble prisoner and not a fish.
Oh. Boo Hoo. Woe is me. I am So very Sad.
The reason, i am sad, you ask?
Fencer: I said nothing.
Why, it is because i am trapped here, doomed to an eternity in this pit.
(Note: NPC yet to be placed in pit)
If only i had a rock, one that may have been considered useless.
In order to free myself, from this shackle.
(Note: Shackle has yet to be drawn)
Then i could be free from this place.
...
...
Fencer: Well. Goodbye the-
Oh brave warrior. A thousand thanks for accepting my quest.
I shall expect you back shortly. Holding a rock.
One that may have once been considered useless.
Fencer: There's a weird focus on this rock here.
It is a beautiful rock. One that has not yet realised its potential in life.
Right now, it believes itself utterly meaningless, but it is unaware of its true destiny.
Have i mentioned that i am not a fish?
Fencer: Several times.
Yes i- wait no.
I only mentioned it once before just now. Have you not been paying attention?
I shall begin again.
Oh brave warrior. A thou-
Fencer: Okay, i'll get your stupid stone. Geez.
I specifically requested a rock.
Fencer: I'm going now!
Thank you.

Ah, you have returned. Salutations, noble warrior.
I see you have brought the once thought useless rock to me. Pass it to me, and i shall free myself forthwith.
fortwit? fourthwidth? Never mind. Now, the roc-
Fencer: I haven't got it yet.
Fencer: Hell i haven't even left the room. Couldn't you tell?
Oh...
Well, though i am not a fish, i confess that my eyes are on the side of my head. It makes it a bit tricky to see you.
Fencer: You do realise that i don't care that you're a fish, right?
Fencer: If anything, it makes you more impressive.
Fencer: What with the whole being on land thing.
...
Don't know what you're talking about.
Anyway, please bring me the rock, so that it may realise its destiny.
Fencer: Yeah yeah. I'll be back soon.
