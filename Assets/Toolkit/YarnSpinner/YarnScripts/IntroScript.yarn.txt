Hello there.
Welcome to Dormant Murders (system demo build 0100).
The game is a 2D Murder Mystery Simulator.
Basically, a person was killed, and it's up to you to find out who the killer was.
Go to the town. Find out who the killer was. Leave the way you came when you think you know who did it.
The town has been abandoned to a scheduled volcano eruption that will destroy everything.
So no one will get in your way.
But there is no one to help you either.
You must deduce everything yourself. Feel free to make notes.
Lots of evidence has been conveniently left behind.
An evacuation order forced the townsfolk out of the area without being able to take their stuff.
With any luck the murderer's signed confession will be under their pillow still.
You're probably not under threat of volcano yourself. It's still just a demo after all.
Though the demo murder is still solvable... I think.
Search everything. Find things. Get access to places. Search those places.

This will never be appreciated, and it is your own fault for ever assuming otherwise. <<changesceneto IntroScript Room208>>
