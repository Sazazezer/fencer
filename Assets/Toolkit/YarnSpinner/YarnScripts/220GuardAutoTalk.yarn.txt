GuardA: Oh boy. Guard duty in the prison. What fun. What fun we have today, ey Sebastian?
GuardB: You're telling me. I have been waiting for guard duty all day yesterday.
GuardA: Which is strange as we were doing guard duty then as well.
GuardB: I know, right? It feels like every day we are doing guard duty, and every day we are excited.
GuardA: Well that is because we are together. And guard duty is best when it is with friends.
GuardB: Indeed, i would die for you, my friend.
GuardA: And i you.
Both: Now that we would ever need to. 
Both: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
GuardA: It is indeed a sweet gig.
GuardB: Indeed. We would be wrong to complain about the easiness of our lives.
GuardA: We should still do so though, on occasion.
GuardB: Yes, that way the the Captain-Commander will give us extra benefits to add onto our easy life 
of watching over a prison that only contains one prisoner.
GuardA: And of course, protecting the Kings.
GuardB: Almost goes without saying.
GuardA: It is a shame i said it then.
Both: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
GuardA: By the way, Sebastian?
GuardB: What is it, Keith?
GuardA: Did you ever find your key?
GuardB: You mean the key to that door over there?

GuardA: Yes, the one to which you are pointing to now.
GuardB: No i did not.

GuardA: Ah. A shame.
GuardB: Such a shame, but ultimately meaningless.
GuardA: As meaningless as our pointless existence in this deary forgotten lair, where the futility of our 
GuardA:lives tick away, every second dripping with self-loathing and despair?
GuardB:...what?
GuardA: I mean... as meaningless as it would be to keep hold of it, seeing as even with the key the only 
GuardA:prisoner we have to watch over would be unable to escape his pit, so even if he had it there would be nothing he could do with it.
GuardB: ...yes. Exactly that.
Both: ...
Both: ...
GuardB: Well, i'm going to go over here now.
GuardA: Very well. I shall stay here.
GuardB: You know... i'm here if you need to talk, Keith. We need to stick together here.
GuardA: Thanks, Sebastian. I appreciate that.
