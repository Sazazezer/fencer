It would have kind of sucked if the tree had died about a year in due to neglect.

A placard dedicated to the planting of the tree at the founding of this village.
It states that so long as the tree stands, so too shall the villagers of Askance in solidarity.
"The village shall not be abandoned. Our hope will forever shine."
Guess they didn't count on volcano explosion death.
