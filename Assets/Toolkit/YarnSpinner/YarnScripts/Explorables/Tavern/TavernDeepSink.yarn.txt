Our god's name is definitely Steve.
And he has one of those climber's beard.
And he's a real nice guy, always at the climbing wall.
But no one ever seems to really know him.

I actually don't know what the UrbEx policy is on using sinks you've found to clean yourself up.
Do i dare risk incuring our god's wrath.
