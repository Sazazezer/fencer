I guess i have to leave eventually.
In a moment.

Not that it lasts.
I have to go back out there eventually.
But for just a moment, the world is silent around me.
Waiting for that inevitable flush.

There's no real reason for it.
Just in here i know i can be silent.
No need to chat, converse, pretend i care.
I can just be me.

Just your standard tavern toilets.
This is probably the only place i feel safe in a bar.
