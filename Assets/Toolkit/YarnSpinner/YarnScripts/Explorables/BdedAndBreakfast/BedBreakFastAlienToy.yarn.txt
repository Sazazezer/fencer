I'm not taking you with me.
Hate me if you must.

I mean, i know no one has to know.
But it's the principle of it.
You start off just taking one cuddly toy, and it snowballs.
Everyone has to be responsible, right?

I'm here to explore, not to loot.
The community suffers when we're all dicks about it.
You understand, right?

Don't look at me like that.
You think i want to leave you to burn.
It's the rules of the game.

Wish i could take it with me.
But alas, to the fire with you.
