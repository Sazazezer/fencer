Sally: Yes. If you are lucky, you will at best be allowed to be in a relationship with me.

Sally: If you are really lucky, it will be heralded by critics as being progressive.

Ann: But most like i will simply cease to be moments after this scene has finished.

Sally: Not even moments.

Sally: Boy i sure do like being a protagonist. I am so glad i have personal motivations and a backstory. Unlike you, Ann.

Ann: Lol yeah. I am an empty meaingless character with no clearly defined goals except for helping or hindering you in some way. I exist solely to be used.
