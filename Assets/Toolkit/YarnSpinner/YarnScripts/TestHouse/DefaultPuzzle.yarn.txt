Well, i got into the drawer.
It's empty, but the feeling of accomplishment drives me to ever dizzying and greater heights.
Instinctively i now know the contents of another journal.
Don't ask questions. You won't get answers.
Wait a second.
There's a fake panel here.
Underneath it is a fully loaded semi automatic pistol.
I'm not particularly knowledgable about guns.
I think it may be a H&K VP70 with 19mm Parabellum rounds.
But I have no clue about these things.
