<<if $TestSideboardLocked is true>>
Locked.
There's an image of a sun by the lock.
An intricatelly detailed image of a sun, carved perfectly into the wood.
Someone went to great lengths to associate this lock with the image of a sun.
It seems unnecessary for day to day life, yet i feel this extreme effort is of immense value to me personally.
...
Maybe there is a connection between the lock and the image of a sun?
Perhaps?
I don't know.

<<if $TestSideboardLocked is false>>
Welp. It's open.
Let's see what's inside, shall we?
...
Yes. Yes we shall.
