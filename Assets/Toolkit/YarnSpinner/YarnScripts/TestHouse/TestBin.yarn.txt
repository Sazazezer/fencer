<<if $got_GoldenBox is true>>
Without the insanely valuable Golden Box that i'm just going to throw away as soon as i look inside it the bin is back to being a normal bin.
Well, it was always a normal bin.
It should not have had ideas above its station.

<<if $got_GoldenBox is false>>
It's just a dustbin. 
Nothing to get excited over.
Inside is a golden box worth millions.
Tiona got the golden box.
