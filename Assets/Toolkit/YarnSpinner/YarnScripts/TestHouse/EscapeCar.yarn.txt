My phone charger is here.
Plenty of battery so it shouldn't be an issue.
But if it runs out i can always sneak back here.
Spend a few hours bumming in the car.
Got snacks too. I'm good in general.
I like to be prepared.

I can leave anytime, i suppose.
Just need to head back here.
There's always a weird feeling on these trips.
That i have to end on some big, high note.
The truth is i just leave because i start feeling self-conscious.
Reality doesn't care either way.

My Car. This is what i arrived in.
I sure do love my car.
I love it because it's so clunky and well worn, and that together we've had many adventures.
I certainly like it better than the previous one.
You know, the placeholder art.
That lovely flashy green car.
This one is sooooooo much better.
