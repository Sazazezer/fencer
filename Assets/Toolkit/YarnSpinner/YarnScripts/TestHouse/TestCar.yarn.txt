My Car. This is what i arrived in.
It looks fancy now, but this is only a piece of placeholder art.
I'll be getting a dingy piece of crap in the full release.
The idea will be that i'm supposed to love it because it's so clunky and well worn, and that together we've had many adventures.
But i tell you now that's a lie.
I wanna keep the flashy one.
