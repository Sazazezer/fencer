Still empty.

<<if $TestAmazingBin is false>>
Oh my god.
I can't believe it.
This bin...
This bin is the most amazing bin ever.
Never before have i seen a bin this amazing.
Its shine. Its luster.
Truly, this is a bin for the ages.
I can only imagine what's in this bin.
I shudder in anticipation, perhaps even in arousal, over what this bin may contain.
I hesitate to reach forwards, to lift a lid that i, an unworthy mere mortal, am not fit to lift.
Even the rustle as i pull it up is a din my pitiful ears are fit to hear.
I look inside, eager to see its contents.
Oh. It's empty.
