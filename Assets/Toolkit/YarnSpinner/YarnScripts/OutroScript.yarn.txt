Congratulations on wasting your time doing something no one cares about.

Your parents would be so proud, were they actually real.

Great. Glad to hear it. Thank you for taking the time to do this.
If it has meant anything, it has meant something to someone.
That is what the word 'meant' means by its very defintion.
Anyway. Game go away now.
Don't forget your inevitable death!
